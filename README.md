Prototype for the Harmony Line Isolator â€” a tool that detects and separates musical roles (high, mid, low) from multi-part vocal harmony recordings. Phase 1 uses deep learning pitch detection (CREPE) to extract pitch contours, assign roles, and export them as MIDI with accuracy validation against ground-truth stems.
